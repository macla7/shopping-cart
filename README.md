An Odin project, <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-cart'>project</a>.

Started off with a typical React inheritence structure, without even really knowing it.. I was trying to use Context for the cart 'state', but realised after reading the react <a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html'>composition vs inheritence'</a>, that I was better off re-structuring. It worked out great, super easy for me to follow from the App component, where every other component is being used.

Used for the first time the react router too. Seems to make sense. Reminds me of my ruby on rails routes.

Something to fix: Definitely a bit of code repeat in the sass. Would implement some standard variables if I had the time.
